                    You can test your knowledge of the Serbian language through the exercises on this page.
                    Choose the exercise you want to do and solve the tasks in order to know at what level your
                    knowledge of Serbian is.
                </p>

                <div class="interactive-title mini-title">
                    <span>about</span>

                <p>
                    Before choosing an exercise, you will be able to see information about it.
                    This information includes the number of questions, the type of questions, the difficulty of
                    the exercises... All exercises are automatically available, which means that you can
                    immediately start doing the most difficult exercises. Each task consists of several
                    questions that can be of different types (multiple answers, writing answers, making
                    sentences...). After the solved exercise, you will receive information about your score.
                </p>

                <div class="interactive-title mini-title">
                    <span>learn from your mistakes</span>
                    <span>learn from your mistakes</span>
                    <span>learn from your mistakes</span>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Exercises can be especially helpful, because if you make a mistake, you will be able to see
                    the correct answer to the question and thus learn from your mistakes.
